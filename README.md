# mbta-times

This is a quick example project that pulls data from a CSV of train times and displays them in a list on a webpage. It's all frontend code: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. The page is hosted on github pages--each time new code is pushed to the `gh-pages` branch, then webpage is automatically updated.
